# extensions
## how to use
the extensions.json file in vscodeextensionsexport is the full extensions file. by putting it into a .vscode you can install from the list using the recomended extensions panel.

## how to sync
just run `npm run run` in the vscodeextensionsexport folder. it will target your vscode and add any new extensions to the extensions file. **just have to make sure the script is pointing to the right vscode location**
